# Hi, I'm Pascal

I am a medical doctor and public health professional currently studying Data Science at UBC.  
My interests include global health, non-communicable diseases, and the use of data-driven methods to improve health systems.  

In my free time, I enjoy running and exploring new ideas in digital health and epidemiology.
